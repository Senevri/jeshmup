JESHMUP: Jarin ja Esan Shoot 'Em UP!

To compile, you need UnitTest++ and SDL (Simple Directmedia Library).

FIXME:
You shouldn't need UnitTest++ to compile the Release version, though...


UnitTest++
----------
Get it from

	http://unittest.cpp.sourceforge.net 

Simple Directmedia Library
--------------------------
Get it from

	http://www.libsdl.org


Compiling on Linux:
-------------------

1. Compile UnitTest++ and SDL as needed
2. Modify the Makefile
	SDL should point to SDL root directory, 
	UNITTEST should point to UnitTest++ root directory.

	You can change the bindir to point wherever you want, naturally.
