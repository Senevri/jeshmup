JESHMUP: Jarin ja Esan Shoot 'Em UP!

To compile, you need UnitTest++ and SDL (Simple Directmedia Library).

FIXME:
You shouldn't need UnitTest++ to compile the Release version, though...


UnitTest++
----------
Get it from

	http://unittest.cpp.sourceforge.net 

Simple Directmedia Library
--------------------------
Get it from

	http://www.libsdl.org

That should do for right now, okyes?
