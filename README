JESHMUP: Jarin ja Esan Shoot 'Em UP!

To compile, you need UnitTest++ and SDL (Simple Directmedia Library).

#Current:
Next step will be updating everything to SDL2, among other things. I've added links to some changed/updated libraries for now.

FIXME:
You shouldn't need UnitTest++ to compile the Release version, though...

Compiling on Linux:
-------------------

1. Make sure SDL dev is successfully installed
2. unzip libs.zip
3. recompile included libraries
4. copy each .a file to libs/linux/
5. in root, qmake, make
6. execute bin in bin-dir, otherwise paths break currently
